This hasn\u2019t been a podcast for a very long time.\u2019 Podcasts, they sit and they go \u2018oh tell me about yourself.\u2019 I don't fucking do that shit.\u201d said Ethan.\r\n\r\nAlthough there's a new name and look, the show is still at its core the same as it has been.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for comedy, we\u2019re here for laughs, and we\u2019re here to have a good time\u201d said Ethan.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new set, designed by the show's member Sam, Ethan has a new microphone.\r\n\r\nAB and the crew are still mourning the loss of his friend, and fellow H3 podcast member Cameron after he departed from the show before break.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not okay, he was my bestie.

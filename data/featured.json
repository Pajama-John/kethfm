There is no further apology, or response to the allegation.\r\n\r\nThe statement comes after Tana Mongeau accused Cody Ko of engaging in sexual acts with her when she was 17 years-old. Cody was 25 at the time. The allegations were brought forth on Tana\u2019s podcast Canceled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say the statement, for me, was surprising.\u201d said Ethan.\r\n\r\nBut, the apology seems to be extremely impersonal, and does not address the main issue at hand, the allegations made on Cody Ko.\r\n\r\n\u201cYeah they didn\u2019t acknowledge anything. It\u2019s actually pretty stunning.\u201d said Ethan.\r\n\r\nCo founder of TMG Studios, Noel Miller, will continue to lead the studio and its productions. It also seems that Cody is still in ownership of the company.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hyper separating the brand from Cody, when Cody is so infused into the brand.\u201d said Olivia.\r\n\r\nEthan and the crew later watch a seven year-old clip of Cody Ko and Adam22 talk in detail about Tana.\r\n\r\nIn the clip, they talk in detail about their predatory relationships and how much they love Tana Mongeau. Saying they would date her. \r\n\r\nTo see more about the Cody Ko allegations on the H3 show click here https://www.youtube.com/live/8r5HosJI4bk?si=gTPA4BR43k_h5mtW&t=3297\r\n", "youtube": "", "tags": ["Cody Ko", "Tana Mongeau", "Ethan", "EP35", "SA", "Drama", "Apology", "Olivia"], "thumbnail": "static/uploads/7-29_Cody_Ko_responds.png"}
